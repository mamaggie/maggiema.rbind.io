<h1>Story Behind This Map</h1>

<p>I was lucky to have worked as a geospatial researcher at a hospital summer of 2020 when the first wave of COVID was in full-swing.
I received the most accurate COVID-19 information working in an office busy with multiple COVID-19 projects and prediction models.
Having seen first hand COVID-19 data and understanding their impacts; speaking with friends and family,
I realized the data wasn’t clear to everyone and some wouldn’t know where to find details of it. </p>

<p>That is when the idea for this passion project was born.
A publicly accessible dashboard that displays COVID-19 daily cases over time at Toronto’s neighborhood level to help combat misinformation by providing interpretable data fundamental in informing smart choices.
This simple interactive map answers questions such as, ‘How did COVID-19 spread in the City of Toronto?’ or ‘Have there been a lot of new cases in my area in the past days or weeks?’</p>

<p> This project, along with a Bayesian COVID-19 prediction model, was awarded the COVID-19 Engagement Award by the University of Toronto. The Bayesian COVID-19 prediction model is not included here. </p>
