I am graduating from the University of Toronto this April with two majors in Statistics and Human Geography, and a minor in Geographic Information System (GIS).   

My research interests lie at the intersection of spatial statistics and data viz/human-computer interaction (HCI). My previous professional and academic experience mostly involved predictive Bayesian modeling, spatial analysis (GIS & INLA in R), interactive map design, and Engineering consulting. My career goal is to leverage spatial data and visualization design principles to generate data-driven insights and solutions which deliver tangible social impact and drive businesses decisions.
